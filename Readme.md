# Final Project Proposal: [Project Title]

## Introduction
This document serves as the proposal for my final project in the Data Science & ML Bootcamp. The project, titled "ترحال | Terhal" aims to address the common challenges faced by travelers exploring Saudi Arabia. Many travelers struggle to find reliable information about local destinations. Traditional sources like travel guides and online reviews often fall short, leading to uncertainty and less-than-ideal travel experiences. Moreover, the lack of direct communication with other travelers deprives them of valuable firsthand recommendations. This project is chosen due to its potential impact on the tourism industry in Saudi Arabia and its alignment with my career goals in data science.

## Background
The problem of exploration enthusiasts finding it challenging to discover similar places within Saudi Arabia and connect with people who share their interests and activities affects both travelers and the tourism industry in the region. This difficulty limits their travel experiences and interactions, making it hard to organize enjoyable and rewarding trips. 

Solving this problem will provide several benefits:
- Enhances the travel experience by making it easier to discover new and interesting destinations.
- Facilitates connections between travelers with similar interests, enriching their travel experiences through shared recommendations and insights.
- Improves trip planning efficiency, making it more convenient for users to organize their journeys.
- Supports the growth of the tourism industry in Saudi Arabia by promoting lesser-known destinations and encouraging more explorative travel.

This project is important as it addresses the needs of modern travelers who seek personalized and authentic travel experiences, ultimately contributing to a more vibrant and connected travel community within Saudi Arabia.

## Project Objectives

- To develop a recommendation system using ResNet-50 that accurately suggests similar locations in Saudi Arabia based on user-uploaded photos.
- To create a user-friendly interface using Streamlit that allows users to easily interact with the recommendation system.
- To analyze the relationship between image-based searches and user interests, facilitating connections between users with similar travel preferences and activities.
- To enhance the travel planning experience by displaying profiles of users who have visited recommended places, thereby making trip organization more efficient and personalized.

### Data Sources

The primary datasets for this project were obtained through web scraping from Instagram and from a Kaggle dataset. These datasets include user-generated content related to travel destinations within Saudi Arabia, consisting of an Excel sheet and a folder of images of various locations.

These datasets were chosen for the following reasons:
- Instagram data provides real-time, user-generated insights and a wide variety of images depicting different places in Saudi Arabia, reflecting current trends and popular spots.
- The Kaggle dataset is comprehensive and well-organized, offering high-quality images and an Excel sheet with detailed metadata.

Preliminary preprocessing steps included:
- Ensuring that the datasets were relevant to the project objectives and discarding any unrelated data.
- Since the datasets were already clean and required minimal preprocessing, the focus was on organizing and structuring the data for efficient use in the recommendation system.

By leveraging these reliable and relevant data sources, the project aims to provide accurate and valuable recommendations to enhance travelers' experiences in Saudi Arabia.

## Methodology

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
    - Analytical techniques: Ensured data relevance and discarded unrelated data, organized and structured the data for efficient use.
    - Used tools: Utilizing Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy.

- **Feature Engineering**:
    - Analytical techniques: Linked Instagram data with users and tourist locations, associating these with different regions in Saudi Arabia.
    - Used tools: Utilized Pandas for data manipulation and integration.

- **Model Development**:
    - Analytical techniques: Developed a recommendation system using ResNet-50 for image-based search and location suggestion.
    - Used tools: Applied PyTorch for model implementation and training.

- **Validation and Testing**: 
    - Analytical techniques: Employed cross-validation techniques to ensure the robustness and accuracy of the recommendation system.
    - Used tools: Used standard cross-validation techniques in PyTorch to validate the model.

By employing these methodologies, the project aims to deliver a robust recommendation system that enhances the travel planning experience for users exploring Saudi Arabia.

## Results

By the conclusion of this project, I anticipate achieving the following results:

- Developing a recommendation system using ResNet-50 that accurately suggests similar locations in Saudi Arabia based on user-uploaded photos.
- Implementing a user-friendly interface using Streamlit for easy interaction with the recommendation system.
- Establishing a link between Instagram user data and tourist locations, enhancing the personalization of travel recommendations.
- Enabling users to connect with others who share similar travel interests and experiences within Saudi Arabia.

These results are expected to significantly improve the travel planning and exploration experiences for users, fostering a more connected and informed travel community in Saudi Arabia.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, "Terhal" aims to utilize advanced data science techniques to tackle the challenge of enhancing travel experiences in Saudi Arabia. By leveraging Instagram data and a curated dataset of tourist locations, this project aims to develop a robust recommendation system powered by ResNet-50. This system will enable travelers to discover similar destinations, connect with like-minded individuals, and efficiently plan enriching trips across Saudi Arabia.

This project is expected to yield several key benefits, including improved travel planning efficiency, enhanced personalization through user-generated content, and the facilitation of meaningful connections among travelers. By addressing these challenges, "Terhal" seeks to contribute to a more informed and interconnected travel community in Saudi Arabia.

I am excited about the potential impact of this project and look forward to exploring how technology can elevate travel experiences in the region.

## Future Improvements:

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Analyze user comments to understand preferences better.
- **Expand Dataset**: Continuously update with diverse user-generated content.
- **Model Refinement**: Fine-tune ResNet-50 for more accurate recommendations.
- **User Feedback**: Integrate ratings and reviews for continuous improvement.
- **Social Features**: Enable direct connections between users for knowledge sharing.
- **Mobile App Development**: Create a mobile app for enhanced accessibility.
- **Data Security**: Strengthen privacy measures to protect user information.
